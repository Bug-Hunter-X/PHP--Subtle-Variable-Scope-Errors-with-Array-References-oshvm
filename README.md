This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in PHP related to variable scope and array manipulation within functions.  The bug arises from the confusion between pass-by-reference and pass-by-value when dealing with arrays.  The example code showcases how different function implementations can lead to unexpected results.  The solution provides clearer ways to manage array modifications within functions to avoid such issues.
